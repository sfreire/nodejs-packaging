nodejs-packaging compatible package for RHEL5/Centos5 based on EPEL sources

This package is based on a "nodejs-packaging" package available in [EPEL 6](https://fedorahosted.org/released/nodejs-packaging/), from T.C. Hollingsworth <tchollingsworth@gmail.com>.
It has patches in order to work in RHEL5/Centos5 and Python 2.4.

The license is the same as the original's author RPM.
